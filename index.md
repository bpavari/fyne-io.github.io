		<p class="text-faded">Fyne's APIs aim to be the best for developing
beautiful, usable, lightweight applications for desktop and beyond. Driven by 
design and usability principles we are breaking free of the current desktop app
drudgery and create a joyous experience.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">Providing a quality user experience is important
on the desktop, in all our apps and also during development. Part of the platform
being created is to provide tools that work as well as the apps we know you're
going to enjoy creating.</p>
