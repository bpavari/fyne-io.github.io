## How we Make Decisions
---

Making decisions quickly is important but we also want to ensure that we've
taken in to account important facts and all viewpoints.
At all times we want to be aligned on the same vision so that coflicting 
opinions are not common and that we're all heading in the same direction.

### Majority 

All large decisions will require majority agreement within the developer community.
As those who make up our community will change over time we consider that any
contributor to the core project software should be included in this decision
making process.

### New Feature Addition

Incremental development or changes that have been agreed upon can be worked
on by any developer, however the addition of new features can lead to
unsupported functionality.
Therefore significant new features should not be added until there are at least
2 contributors prepared to support the ongoing development.
