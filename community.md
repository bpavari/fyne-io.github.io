our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body

include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## How we Make Decisions
---

Making decisions quickly is important but we also want to ensure that we've taken in to account important views and check we are heading in the right direction.

### Majority 

Each decision will require majority agreement within the developer community (defined as contributors to the project affected).

### New Feature Addition

Significant new features should not be added until there are at least 2 contributors prepared to support their ongoing development.
