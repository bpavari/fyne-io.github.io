You heard right - 3 platforms in only 3 weeks. Fyne now [supports](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/wiki/Supported-Platforms)
Linux, Mac OS X and Windows! Using the [EFL](https://enlightenment.org) for
rendering has meant that getting up and running across multiple platforms has
been possible even before our first milestone. Having all of them under our
belt already means that we're already in a good position to welcome developers
from many backgrounds.

To show off the progress so far the [examples](https://github.com/fyne-io/examples)
repository has now got a calculator app. This works exactly as expected across
all supported platfors (well it would - the code is identical!) and looks pretty decent as well. A basic colour scheme was loaded from the [material design](https://material.io) guidelines in 2 variants - light and dark. So any Fyne app 
can look great on a light or a dark themed desktop.

That's everything for now, we leave you with these great screen grabs.
