As GitHub recently emailed me with congratulations on 500 commits in Fyne
I thought it was time for a quick review of statistics... The project has
been under way now for 9 months and we have come a long way from the initial
idea. In fact we have:

* 500 Commits
* 215 Star gazers
* 13  Forks
* 4   Contributors
* 2   **Drivers**

What a few months it's been! Yes the project is gaining momentum and we're
seeing cool new example apps - but the biggest news is the additional driver.
We now have a fully functioning OpenGL based driver that can replace the EFL
dependency.

If you don't have EFL installed and/or can't get it set up then we finally have
an alternative. The new driver can be activated using the "gl" tag on any go
run or build command for any Fyne based application

```sh
go run -tags gl .
```

This new driver has no external library dependencies which makes it far more portable. Applications built with this new driver will run happily on a different
computer to the one it was built on.

Please give it a shot and raise any issues you find - this is going to be a fun
new chapter in the Fyne story!
