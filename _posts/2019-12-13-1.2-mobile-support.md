The 1.2 release of the fyne toolkit marks an exciting milestone in the project as we now support building
for iOS and Android devices as well as macOS, Windows, Linux and BSD. We also vastly improved the developer
experience for creating your own widgets and extending existing widgets to add custom functionality.

It's been a massive journey to get to this point and nearly 500 commits of work from our community got us
there. We hope that you are as excited as us to be able to easily build beautiful native apps for both
desktop and mobile devices with simple Fyne code.

Along with all of the development work we are excited to have a great new logo for the project which you
can see below in the desktop and mobile screenshots of our latest demo app.

We're excited to see what apps our community comes up with whilst we get on with our next release.
Happy Christmas!

The additional highlights of our release are as follows:

## Added

## Changed

* New Logo! Thanks to Storm for his work on this :)

* FYNE_THEME and FYNE_SCALE are now overrides to the global configuration
* The first opened window no longer exits the app when closed (unless none others are open or Window.SetMaster() is called)
