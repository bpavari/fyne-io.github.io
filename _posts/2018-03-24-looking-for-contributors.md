Six weeks into the Fyne project and the basics are all in place!
We were tracking the initial phases through the GitHub project 
[Walking Skeleton](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/projects/1) and the tasks
completed a short while ago. Since then the work has been focussed on
[documentation](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/wiki), the project
[roadmap](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/wiki/Roadmap) and API documentation.

Now things are up and running there's so much to do. Design, widgets, layout
and a richer canvas are all needed to get to the first milestone "UI Toolkit".
With our outlined vision and the documentation in place it should be
easy for new developers, designers and testers to get involved.

So we're putting a shout out to Go developers, UI designers and anyone
else interested in building a great new desktop environment to get in touch.
